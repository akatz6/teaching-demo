Flex box.
    I looooooooooove using flex box. 
    So far we have covered display:block and display:inline-block for the children elements to display elements on the same row. We also covered using margin to put some space between the elements, but what looks good on a big screen looks funky on a phone.

    In developer tools you can play around with different sizes of screens. If you put a margin-left of 50px it might look good in one size but not great in another. On solution is to use '%' instead of 'px' but this leads to a guessing game. There is a better way and that if lex box.
